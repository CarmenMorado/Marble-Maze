# Marble-Maze
100 Days of Swift (Project 26) A rolling ball game for iPad, using the accelerometer â€“ the user tilts their device, and the balls rolls in that direction, 
hopefully avoiding holes as they go. Throughout the course of this project, I familiarized myself with how to load a game level from a file and how to create 
custom physics bitmasks, while also getting some practice with fatalError(), SKAction, reading the accelerometer using Core Motion, combining bitmasks using |, 
SKAction sequences, and more. In addition, I completed the following challenges:

-Rewrite the loadLevel() method so that it's made up of multiple smaller methods. This will make your code easier to read and easier to maintain, or at least it should do if you do a good job!

-When the player finally makes it to the finish marker, nothing happens. What should happen? Well, that's down to you now. You could easily design several new levels and have them progress through.

-Add a new block type, such as a teleport that moves the player from one teleport point to the other. Add a new letter type in loadLevel(), add another collision type to our enum, then see what you can do.
